- 👋 Hi, I’m Kenneth Hironaka!
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and C++.
- 🏝️ I'm originally from Kauai.
- 🏫 I'm a freshman in Computer Engineering.
- ⚒️ I chose CENG because I enjoy how it combines Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, two things I want to pursue.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a 2000+ day streak on Duolingo.
- 📖 What do I want to learn from EE 205? How to code in C and C++ and also how to code bigger projects that aren't just simple programs.
- 🎞️ A movie I'd recommend is Spiderman: Far From Home.
